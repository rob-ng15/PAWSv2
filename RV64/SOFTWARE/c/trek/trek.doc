            STAR TREK is an advanced battle simulation game based on the
            T.V. series of the same name, circa 1966 ACE.

                                  INTRODUCTION

            At the computer console, you are the captain of a starship of
    the Federation of Planets.  Your ship is of the Enterprise class, the
    largest, and most powerful ships in the galaxy.  In the simulation, you
    will battle Klingons, Romulans, and a host of other "enemy" starships.

            You have at your command Phasers, Photon Torpedoes, Matter-
    antimatter Probes, Navigational computers, Auto-track scanners, and an
    enormous reserve of power to operate these and other functions.

            The enemy starships are lighter, faster, and have stronger
    screens than the Enterprise class.  However, they have less power at
    the start.  Other than the above, the starships of all worlds are
    approximately equal in a head to head battle, as destructive weaponry
    has reached the point where only exploding stars can deliver more energy
    than a fully armed starship.

            There are more possibilities in the end of the game than mere win
    or lose.  A TOTAL VICTORY is where you have either completely destroyed
    the enemy, or better yet, forced him to surrender without killing his
    whole crew.  (Romulans have never been known to surrender.)  A TACTICAL
    VICTORY is one where you have out-run, out-maneuvered, or exhausted the
    fuel supply of the enemy.  A MORAL (Phyrric) VICTORY is where you self-
    destruct rather than surrender an Enterprise class starship; or, in
    blowing up, manage to take the enemy with you!  A loss is when you are
    either destroyed, or surrender.  (Romulans have never taken prisoners.)

            In the play of the game, distances are given in megameters(M),
    speeds in warp-factors ( 1 warp = 100 M/sec. ).

            Angles are expressed in degrees counterclockwise from 0 to 360,
    measured from the X-axis...to the right on the screen...similar to a
    protractor.  The game is played in two dimensions only.


            As Captain, you give any one of 19 different commands.  The enemy
    gives a similar command under computer control and both commands are
    carried out simultaneuosly, as the ships move through space.  The process
    is repeated until certain end-game conditions are met...at which time,
    you will be informed of the outcome.  You are cautioned to make your
    moves quickly and decisively, as an error in a command decision can have
    fatal results to you and your crew.


            The battle simulation proceeds in two second "blocks" where the
    positions of the ships, torpedoes, probes, etc. are plotted in .25 sec-
    ond intervals in the computer.  Each move therefore consumes two seconds
    of simulated time.  This simulated time will become quite long as the
    number of objects in space increases.

                                     POWER


            Starships of the Federation, and throughout the galaxy, are
    almost universally powered by matter-antimatter annihilation.  The
    starships you will encounter are all powered by this method, using
    electromagnetic force fields (pods) to contain the energy generated by
    the Dilithium Generators.  These pods maintain an electromagnetic
    separation between the alpha and anti-alpha particles.  When the pod is
    "relaxed" the particles come into contact, resulting in an almost pure
    matter to energy conversion, in the form of heat (92%) and neutron
    radiation (8%).

            The pods themselves are manufactured using an extremely difficult
    technique, and cannot be made aboard a starship.  As a result, once a
    commander has destroyed all the pods on board, his Dilithium Generator
    becomes relatively useless, though it may still be working, because the
    alpha and anti-alpha particles cannot be transported to the various
    sections of the ship that need power without the pods.  (Pods are moved
    about the ship using a system very similar to the ancient pressure-vacuum
    message system used in old Earth "department stores" circa 1940 C.E.)

            The Dilithium Generator is initially capable of charging 10 pods
    per second.  Each WARP factor consumes 1 pod per second.  Each active
    SHIELD requires 1 pod per second, initially, increasing with each hit on
    a shield.  A Photon Torpedo requires 10 pods, initially.  Each Phaser
    bank requires 10 units of energy for a full charge (10 pods) and there
    are 4 banks of Phasers.  Probes can contain 10 or more pods each, the
    number being selected just before firing.  So, as you may readily see,
    energy management on board a starship can be an important factor.
    However, the initial starship parameters are set up so that it is rare
    that power distribution will have to be altered during the course of a
    battle.

            The efficiency of the Dilithium Generator begins to decrease as
    sudden, high loads are imposed on it, such as a very heavy shield hit.
    The Dilithium Crystals begin to fuse and crack, and are not repairable
    on board the ship.  Loss of efficiency is permanent loss of efficiency!!
    Also, the shield generators suffer a similar loss of efficiency after a
    hard hit, but the shields remain up as long as possible...and start to
    consume inordinate amounts of the ship's power.  Weakened shields not
    only use more power, but lose their shielding effectiveness as well.

            Running at high warp speeds will deplete the reserve power, as
    any maneuvering above warp 6 results in a net loss to the ship's energy
    reserves.  Energy may be built back up by cutting speed and/or dropping
    the shields.

                                   COMMANDS:


    1       FIRE PHASERS

            Phasers are electromagnetic radiation beams similar to lasers,
    in that they emit a coherent beam of energy in "phase" packets... a sort
    of electromagnetic "machine gun."  When fired, they completely discharge
    their stored energy, as in a discharging capacitor.  The maximum
    effective range of a Phaser is 1000M, beyond which they have no more
    effect than a searchlight.  The Phaser banks will automatically recharge
    in one second (unless altered by the commander) using 10 pods per bank.
            Phasers may be set to automatically track an enemy vessel, but
    the firing angle off the bow is only plus or minus 125 degrees (from 235
    to 0 to 125, going counterclockwise).  They may also be manually set to
    any given angle off the bow.  Phasers on auto-track will follow an enemy
    around your stern, or blind side, but will not fire unless clear of your
    Engineering Section.
            A Phaser may fire with a spread of from 10 degrees to 45 degrees,
    the narrow beam normally being used for single targets, the wide for mul-
    tiple targets such as torpedoes.  The hit-factor decreases with both the
    spread and range to the target.  Once again, the searchlight analogy is
    appropriate: sharp or broad focus, energy decreasing as the square of the
    distance.
            The Phasers may be set to discharge only partially during firing,
    but the hit factor is decreased accordingly.  Similarly, the initial
    recharge rate is 100% (charge fully in 1 second) but may be set to some
    lesser value if energy becomes critical.


    q      *PHASER STATUS/LOCK PHASERS ON BEARING OR TARGET

            This command gives a report of deployment, levels, firing
    percentages, and charge/discharge rates of all phasers.  It will also
    prompt for which phasers to lock - press <Return> if you only want the
    status report.  Otherwise, enter the phasers to lock.  You may lock them on
    either an enemy vessel or an angle off the ship's bow, in degrees.  Phasers
    set to auto-track a vessel will continue to track the given vessel until
    redirected or damaged.  They will not fire, when commanded, if Engineering
    is in the way.  Viewing the status report takes no time, however, locking
    the phasers does use a turn.

                                       6.



    2       FIRE PHOTON TORPEDOES

            All starships have six Photon Torpedo tubes, which must be
    loaded (Command 9) before firing.  A tube will be loaded with 10 pods or
    whatever is left in the engines if less than 10.  The pods are held in a
    magneto-photon field (hence "Photon Torpedo"), and are normally launched
    at warp 12 in .25 second intervals.  Hits by Photon Torpedoes cause heavy
    damage to shields, but do not destroy as much equipment and personnel as
    Phasers.
            The firing angle of the tubes is plus or minus 135 degrees off
    the bow of the starship.
            Photon Torpedoes contain both a time and a proximity fuse.  The
    proximity fuse will detonate if within 200M of a starship, but is not
    armed until the torpedo has traveled 150% of its proximity distance.
    The time fuse will detonate the torpedo at 10.0 seconds, at which time
    the torpedo will have traveled 12000M, its maximum effective range.  All
    torpedoes travel in a straight line from the point of firing, and they
    may therefore be maneuvered away from...if you're quick!!


    w      *TUBE STATUS/LOCK TUBES ON BEARING OR TARGET

            Tube status is a report of deployment, levels, launch speeds,
    proximity delays, and time delays for all tubes.  This command is
    completely analogous to the 'q' Phaser status command above.

    3       PROBE CONTROL (LAUNCH, DETONATE, REDIRECT)

            A Probe is a slow-moving device with an internal guidance system
    which allows it to track an enemy ship, or to follow any given course.
    You must specify the number of pods in the Probe (at least 10) and the
    proximity and time delays.  Proximity fuses should normally be set in the
    range of from 100 to 500M.  Be careful of launching Probes with large
    numbers of pods, as the explosion radius becomes enormous, and it would be
    easy to damage your own vessel!  Probes travel at warp 2.
             This command displays the status of your launched probes, if any,
    and asks if you wish to launch one.  If not, you have the option to
    detonate all your probes, to detonate a specific probe, or to redirect one
    that may have missed.  Similarly to aiming phasers and tubes above, a
    probe may track an enemy vessel or may follow an actual course in degrees.


    e       ALTER POWER DISTRIBUTION

            This command allows you to alter the power to the Shields and
    Phaser banks.  Phasers, once charged, draw no further power until fired,
    whereupon they use up 1 pod each for recharging.  They will recharge
    fully in 1 second (+10) or, if, say, set to (+5), in 2 seconds.  They may
    be discharged fully in 1 second (-10) if extra power is needed elsewhere.
            Shields consume one pod worth of energy per second.  This rate
    may be reduced if desired...keeping in mind that they are weakened,
    accordingly.

                                       7.


    4       LOAD/UNLOAD TUBES

            The tubes will be loaded with 10 pods each, unless your fuel runs
    out.  You must specify the tubes to be loaded.  Tubes may be unloaded if
    the need arises.  If a loaded tube is damaged, the pods there are lost.


    r       ALTER TORPEDO AND PHASER PARAMETERS

            This command allows the Captain to alter torpedo launch speeds,
    time and proximity fuses.  Initially torpedoes are launched at warp 12,
    have 200M proximity fuses, and 10 second delays.
            Phaser firing percentages may also be altered.


    5       MANUALLY CHANGE COURSE AND SPEED

            This command allows the Captain to select any course and/or
    speed; particularly useful when dodging torpedoes, probes, etc.  The
    turning rate of a starship is proportional to its velocity: a ship can
    turn at a rate defined by R = 5 * (10 - v), so that a ship moving warp 3
    can turn 35 degrees per second, while at warp 9 it can turn only 5
    degrees per second.  The enemy's top velocity is warp 11; yours is 9.
    His turn rate is R = 5 * (12 - v), so he is more maneuverable.


    t      *ALTER DISPLAY RADIUS

            Unlike the previous version of this game, the position report and
    position displays are always on-screen.
            The position report shows the range, course, bearing, and speed of
    all vessels.  Bearings are off the bow of your ship; courses are absolute.
            The display is a "radar" map of your immediate vicinity.  This
    command is used to select the scan range (in Megameters).  Your vessel is
    shown by "+", Torpedoes by ":", Probes by "*", a jettisoned Engineering
    Section by "#", and enemy vessels by the first letter of their name.  Like
    a radar display, if two targets occupy virtually the same position, only
    one will show on the display.


    6       PURSUE ENEMY VESSEL

            This command causes the computer to attempt to attempt to keep
    the bow of the ship facing toward the enemy ship indicated.  You must
    Also select a speed: positive warp speeds are "forwards" with respect to
    the bow, negative warp speeds are "reverse" or "backing up."  Starships
    move forward or backward with equal facility.
            This command is almost always required when battling another
    ship, as neither torpedoes nor phasers can fire off the stern.


    y       RUN FROM ENEMY VESSEL

            Opposite to pursuing: keep the stern facing the enemy.

                                       8.


    7      *DAMAGE REPORT

            This command gives the internal status of your ship.  A damaged
    warp drive (somewhat common) limits your speed to warp .9999.  A damaged
    computer makes command codes 6, y, and 8 impossible.  Auto-tracking of
    weapons in codes q and w is also impossible, though aiming these weapons
    at a bearing will still be allowed.  It's a very rare occurrence.  Damaged
    sensors makes command codes t and u impossible.
            When your crew of 450 is dead, the game ends.  The enemy crews
    are 350 each.
            Damaged torpedoes and phasers are indicated by "--", shield
    efficiency drops with each hit, as does the warp drive efficiency.
            "Regeneration" refers to the output of the Dilithium Generator,
    initially 10 pods per second.


    u       SCAN ENEMY VESSEL

            A scan of the enemy identical to Command 7.


    8       INITIATE/ABORT SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE

            This command will either begin or stop the self-destruct sequence.
    If no self destruct is in effect, the sequence will be started.  If it is
    in effect, and at least 5 seconds remain, the destruct sequence will be
    aborted.  The destruct sequence sets a 20-second time fuse on the starship
    itself, and takes ten turns to become effective.  You are hoping that the
    force of your self-destruction will take the enemy with you.


    i       JETTISON/DETONATE ENGINEERING

            The Engineering Section of your starship may be jettisoned,
    though this was never done in the television series.  It may, at certain
    times, be your only resort, however.
            If you jettison Engineering, the following will occur:
    1) You lose your fuel, warp drive, probe launcher, and Dilithium
       Generator.
    2) You lose your shields unless you discharge your phasers.
    3) The Engineering section decelerates to a stop, and a ten-second fuse
       is armed on the fuel remaining in the Section.
    4) You are free to fire your phasers and torpedoes in any direction.
    5) You are left with impulse power only, and your top speed is warp .999
            If you have already jettisoned your Engineering Section, this
    command will detonate it at any time before the ten-second fuse expires.

                                       9.


    9       ASK ENEMY TO SURRENDER

            This command sends a message to the enemy demanding that they
    surrender. Starfleet records show no instance where Romulans have
    surrendered a vessel.

    o       SURRENDER

            This command sends a message to the enemy asking him to accept
    your surrender.  He will then decide whether to finish you off or take
    you prisoner.  If he asks you to drop your shields, and stand by, you
    had better do just that, or he'll resume his attack.  You will probably
    not be able to surrender to Romulans, as they have never taken any
    prisoners (alive).

    0       ATTEMPT DEFENSELESS RUSE

            The defenseless ruse will drop your shields, and power may be
    diverted to either your engines or your phasers (your choice).  Hopefully,
    the enemy will either come too close, thinking you are helpless, or will
    turn away, thinking you are dead.  You get a brief chance to either destroy
    him, or run away, depending on his reaction to this ploy...if any.
    Remember, he has scanners, too!

    p       ATTEMPT CORBOMITE BLUFFE

            The Corbomite bluff was used twice in the television series.  In
    theory, you threaten the enemy with an "ultimate" weapon, and see if he
    backs down.  If he does, you get time to either run away or set up for
    some careful shooting.  If he doesn't, he doesn't!!

                                   STRATEGY
                                (for beginners)

            At first, respond to "...name is: " with the name "NOVICE".
    This will greatly increase the time that you have to select your commands.
    Pursue the enemy at warp 1, load and aim your tubes, and aim your phasers.
    Fire your torpedoes, and when in range, your phasers. If you feel pressed
    for time, use F15 to stop the timer.  This doesn't take a turn, and will
    stop the run until you enter a response.  Hopefully, if you throw
    everything you have at him, you'll wipe him out.

            After you have mastered one attacker, you will want to learn the
    use of various maneuvering tactics, and the art of launching probes.
    To do so, specify two attackers. When you are really skilled, try three
    or more. You will have your hands full then!!


                        INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING "TREK"

            Run the "trekx" binary with no arguments.

            The input of commands is timed, and the game will continue play
    whether it receives your commands or not...  The top two rows of normal
    keyboard keys are used for command input, with 1-9,0,- being the normal
    keys and qwertyuiop[ being the additional commands..

            When the console requests the name of an enemy ship, either the
    whole name or just the first initial may be input.  Similarly, when tube
    or phaser numbers are requested, the input is free format: "345", "3,4,5",
    and "3 4 5" are all legal.  Also, when selecting weapon targets (codes
    3, q, & w), an angle in degrees may replace a ship name.

            This version includes a dynamic display of the Position Report;
    future versions will include the ability to play between two consoles,
    and, eventually, the ability to command fleets in a multiple-console
    game.
