 * History:
 * 11/xx/90 - was made aware of existance of the Fortran source
 *  (twm)     written by Justin S. Revenaugh
 * 12/01/90 - converted Fortran source to C.  Added variable
 *  (twm)     delay to the program.  Then decided to add the
 *            variable object options to the program and command
 *            line parsing.  The biggest change was adding better
 *            data structures in order to create objects.  Each
 *            object has associated with it the necessary state
 *            information as well as space for its line graphics.
 * 12/07/90   Hacked in a little bit more X support for iconification
 *  (twm)     and redrawing.  Changed gprmultiline/gprpolyling to
 *            get rid of the malloc call during every draw operation.

1st release 12/12/90

12/13/90
 * change naming convention...keep names under 14 characters.
 * fix problem in c_graphics.c in routine updatedisplay();
       change size of char text[] from 10 to 11.
 * free objects prior to calling scores.  prevents a highly
       unlikely failure from malloc if you're playing with
       several thousand objects.
 * it is possible for the game to hang on startup, if you place
       the window in the upper left.  we force an initial resize
       by creating the window one pixel wider/longer than we need.
--ON EXPO --

12/18/90
 * changed how the username was found.  look for it in the passwd
       file first, then use getlogin() if necessary.  this allows
       people who su from another acct to play under their own
       name.
 * added a PatchLevel.h file...

12/19/90
 * added an option to flush any output to the tty.  This option allows
       the game to be backgrounded from inception, as well as letting
       it run from X menus.
 * moved scorefile to X display, unless just scores asked for.
 * now using RCS...should make it easier to track bug reports.

12/23/90
 * added a cursor.
 * placed some objects into pixmaps...should make the game playable on
    machines which don't draw circles well.

12/30/90
 * added the preliminary color support.  unfortunately, i have only a limited
    number of machines on which to test the changes, so i'll have to depend
    on alpha-testers here.

01/01/91
 * finished preliminary color support...bitblt should now work correctly
   on color machines.  We try to use the default colormap first.  If
   that fails, we try to create our own colormap.  Lastly, we'll run in
   mono.

01/04/91
 * fixed problem with buildpixmaps() computing the depth of display
   incorrectly.   i was always looking at screen 0, when i should have
   been using the default screen.
 * added preliminary resources...

01/13/91
 * finished resources.   options are first parsed through the resource
   manager and then by parseopts().
 * color is now fully supported.
 * cursor is now an option, off by default.
 * no longer let the player place the window, since we're going to move
   it anyway.
 * updated the helpfile
 * an imakefile is now present.
 * the environment variable PAGER now allows the player to select how to
   read the helpfile and/or message-of-the-day.
01/26/91
 * changed fonts...used ISO standard fontnames.
 * game no longer takes up whole window.  now the cursor is confined to the
   game window.
 * game window is redrawn on an expose event, even if paused.  tanks/blocks
   are not redrawn however.

Changes-Yet-to-Be
 * ask if the player wants to play another game, after one has ended.
 * check to see if flock() is available...do all sysv systems have
       lockf()?
 * find some nice common fonts...
 * check for bad return statuses in setcolormap
 * make a man page
