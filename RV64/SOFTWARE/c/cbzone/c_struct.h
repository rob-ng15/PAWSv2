 * cbzone_structs.h
 *  -- Todd W Mummert, December 1990, CMU
 *
 * This file contains the two major structures that we use in
 * the game.  Every object is of type Generic...while we have an
 * Option type in order to allow us to pass options easily and
 * quickly.
 *
 * The most hazardous piece of this code is assuming that
 * XSegments and XPoints continue to be made of shorts.  However,
 * I don't want to address the drawing elements by their
 * structure names, so I'm betting on them remaining shorts.
