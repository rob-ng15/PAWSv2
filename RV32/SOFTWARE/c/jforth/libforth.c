## Introduction

This file implements the core Forth interpreter, it is written in portable
C99. The file contains a virtual machine that can interpret threaded Forth
code and a simple compiler for the virtual machine, which is one of its
instructions. The interpreter can be embedded in another application and
there should be no problem instantiating multiple instances of the
interpreter.

The structure of this file is as follows:

1) Headers and configuration macros
2) Enumerations and constants
3) Helping functions for the compiler
4) API related functions and Initialization code
5) The Forth virtual machine itself
6) An example main function called **main_forth** and support functions

Each section will be explained in detail as it is encountered.

An attempt has been made to make this document flow, as both a source
code document and as a description of how the Forth kernel works.
This is helped by the fact that the program is small and compact
without being written in obfuscated C. It is, as mentioned, compact,
and can be difficult to understand regardless of code quality. Some
of the semantics of Forth will not be familiar to C programmers.

A basic understanding of how to use Forth would help as this document is
meant to describe how a Forth implementation works and not as an
introduction to the language. A quote about the language from Wikipedia
best sums the language up:

	"Forth is an imperative stack-based computer programming language
	and programming environment.

	Language features include structured programming, reflection (the
	ability to modify the program structure during program execution),
	concatenative programming (functions are composed with juxtaposition)
	and extensibility (the programmer can create new commands).

	...

	A procedural programming language without type checking, Forth features
	both interactive execution of commands (making it suitable as a shell
	for systems that lack a more formal operating system) and the ability
	to compile sequences of commands for later execution."

Forth has a philosophy like most languages, one of simplicity, compactness
and of trying only to solve the problem at hand, even going as far as to try
to simplify the problem or replace the problem (which may span multiple
domains, not just software) with a simpler one. This is often not
a realistic way of tackling things and Forth has fallen out of
favor, it is nonetheless an interesting language which can be
implemented and understood by a single programmer (another integral part
of the Forth philosophy).

The core of the concept of the language - simplicity I would say - is
achieved by the following:

1) The language uses Reverse Polish Notation to enter expressions and parsing
is simplified to the extreme with space delimited words and numbers being
the most complex terms. This means a abstract syntax tree does not need to
be constructed and terms can be executed as soon as they are parsed. The
*parser* can described in only a handful of lines of C.
2) The language uses concatenation of Forth words (called functions in
other language) to create new words, this allows for small programs to
be created and encourages *factoring* definitions into smaller words.
3) The language is untyped.
4) Forth functions, or words, take their arguments implicitly and return
variables implicitly via a variable stack which the programmer explicitly
interacts with. A comparison of two languages behavior best illustrates the
point, we will define a function in C and in Forth that simply doubles a
number. In C this would be:

	int double_number(int x)
	{
		return x << 1;
	}

And in Forth it would be:

	: 2* 1 lshift ;

No types are needed, and the arguments and the return values are not
stated, unlike in C. Although this has the advantage of brevity, it is now
up to the programmer to manages those variables.

5) The input and output facilities are set up and used implicitly as well.
Input is taken from **stdin** and output goes to **stdout**, by default.
Words that deal with I/O uses these file steams internally.
6) Error handling is traditionally non existent or limited.
7) This point is not a property of the language, but part of the way the
Forth programmer must program. The programmer must make their factored word
definitions *flow*. Instead of reordering the contents of the stack for
each word, words should be made so that the reordering does not have to
take place (ie. Manually performing the job of a optimizing compile another
common theme in Forth, this time with memory reordering).

The implicit behavior relating to argument passing and I/O really reduce
program size, the type of implicit behavior built into a language can
really define what that language is good for. For example AWK is naturally
good for processing text, thanks in large part to sensible defaults for how
text is split up into lines and records, and how input and output is
already set up for the programmer.

An example of this succinctness in AWK is the following program, which
can be typed in at the command line. It will read from the standard
input if no files are given, and print any lines longer than eighty characters
along with the line number of that line:

	awk '{line++}length > 80 {printf "%04u: %s\n", line, $0}' file.txt ...

For more information about AWK see:

* <http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html>
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK>
* <http://www.pement.org/awk/awk1line.txt>

Forth likewise can achieve succinctness and brevity because of its implicit
behavior.

Naturally we try to adhere to Forth philosophy, but also to Unix philosophy
(which most Forths do not do), this is described later on.

Glossary of Terms:

	VM             - Virtual Machine
	Cell           - The Virtual Machines natural Word Size, on a 32 bit
		       machine the Cell will be 32 bits wide
	Word           - In Forth a Word refers to a function, and not the
		       usual meaning of an integer that is the same size as
		       the machines underlying word size, this can cause confusion
	API            - Application Program Interface
	interpreter    - as in byte code interpreter, synonymous with virtual
		       machine.
	REPL           - Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop, this Forth actually provides
		       something more like a "REL", or Read-Evaluate-Loop (as printing
		       has to be done explicitly), but the interpreter is interactive
		       which is the important point
	RPN            - Reverse Polish Notation (see
		       <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation>).
		       The Forth interpreter uses RPN to enter expressions.
	The stack      - Forth implementations have at least two stacks, one for
		       storing variables and another for control flow and temporary
		       variables, when the term *stack* is used on its own and with
		       no other context it refers to the *variable stack* and not
		       the *return stack*. This *variable stack* is used for
		       passing parameters into and return values to functions.
	Return stack   - Most programming languages have a call stack, C has one
		       but not one that the programmer can directly access, in
		       Forth manipulating the return stack is often used.
	factor         - factoring is splitting words into smaller words that
		       perform a specific function. To say a word is a natural
		       factor of another word is to say that it makes sense to take
		       some functionality of the word to be factored and to create
		       a new word that encapsulates that functionality. Forth
		       encourages heavy factoring of definitions.
	Command mode   - This mode executes both compiling words and immediate
		       words as they are encountered
	Compile mode   - This mode executes immediate words as they are
		       encountered, but compiling words are compiled into the
		       dictionary.
	Primitive      - A word whose instruction is built into the VM.

/**
## Enumerations and Constants
**/

/**
This following string is a forth program that gets called when creating a
new Forth environment, it is run before the user gets a chance to do anything.

The program is kept as small as possible, but is dependent on the virtual
machine image being set up correctly with other, basic, constants being defined
first, they will be described as they are encountered. Suffice to say,
before this program is executed the following happens:

  1) The virtual machine image is initialized
  2) All the virtual machine primitives are defined
  3) All registers are named and some constants defined
  4) **;** is defined

Of note, words such as **if**, **else**, **then**, and even comments
- **(** -, are not actually Forth primitives, there are defined in terms
of other Forth words.

The Forth interpreter is a simple loop that does the following:

	Start the interpreter loop <-----------<-----------------<---.
	Get a space delimited word                                    \
	Attempt to look up that word in the dictionary                 \
	Was the word found?                                             ^
	|-Yes:                                                          |
	|   Are we in compile mode?                                     |
	|   |-Yes:                                                      ^
	|   | \-Is the Word an Immediate word?                          |
	|   |   |-Yes:                                                  |
	|   |   | \-Execute the word >--------->----------------->----->.
	|   |   \-No:                                                   |
	|   |     \-Compile the word into the dictionary >------->----->.
	|   \-No:                                                       |
	|     \-Execute the word >------------->----------------->----->.
	\-No:                                                           ^
	  \-Can the word be treated as a number?                        |
	    |-Yes:                                                      |
	    | \-Are we in compile mode?                                 |
	    |   |-Yes:                                                  |
	    |   | \-Compile a literal into the dictionary >------>----->.
	    |   \-No:                                                   |
	    |     \-Push the number to the variable stack >------>----->.
	    \-No:                                                       |
	      \-An Error has occurred, print out an error message >---->.

As you can see, there is not too much too it, however there are still a lot
of details left out, such as how exactly the virtual machine executes words
and how this loop is formed.

A short description of the words defined in **initial_forth_program**
follows, bear in mind that they depend on the built in primitives, the
named registers being defined, as well as **state** and **;**.

	here      - push the current dictionary pointer
	[         - immediately enter command mode
	]         - enter compile mode
	>mark     - make a hole in the dictionary and push a pointer to it
	:noname   - make an anonymous word definition, push token to it, the
	    definition is terminated by ';' like normal word definitions.
	if        - immediate word, begin if...else...then clause
	else      - immediate word, optional else clause
	then      - immediate word, end if...else...then clause
	begin     - immediate word, start a begin...until loop
	until     - immediate word, end begin...until loop, jump to matching
	    begin at run time if top of stack is zero.
	')'       - push a ")" character to the stack
	(         - begin a Forth comment, terminated by a )
	rot       - perform stack manipulation: x y z => y z x
	-rot      - perform stack manipulation: x y z => z x y
	tuck      - perform stack manipulation: x y   => y x y
	nip       - perform stack manipulation: x y   => y
	allot     - allocate space in the dictionary
	bl        - push the space character to the stack
	space     - print a space
	.         - print out current top of stack, followed by a space

/**
@brief The main structure used by the virtual machine is **forth_t**.

The structure is defined here and not in the header to hide the implementation
details it, all API functions are passed an opaque pointer to the structure
(see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer>).

Only three fields are serialized to the file saved to disk:

1) **header**

2) **core_size**

3) **m**

And they are done so in that order, **core_size** and **m** are save in
whatever endianess the machine doing the saving is done in, however
**core_size** is converted to a **uint64_t** before being save to disk
so it is not of a variable size. **m** is a flexible array member
**core_size** number of members.

The **m** field is the virtual machines working memory, it has its own internal
structure which includes registers, stacks and a dictionary of defined words.

The **m** field is laid out as follows, assuming the size of the virtual
machine is 32768 cells big:

	.-----------------------------------------------.
	| 0-3F      | 40-7BFF       |7C00-7DFF|7E00-7FFF|
	.-----------------------------------------------.
	| Registers | Dictionary... | V stack | R stack |
	.-----------------------------------------------.

	V stack = The Variable Stack
	R stack = The Return Stack

The dictionary has its own complex structure, and it always starts just
after the registers. It includes scratch areas for parsing words, start up
code and empty space yet to be consumed before the variable stack. The sizes
of the variable and returns stack change depending on the virtual machine
size. The structures within the dictionary will be described later on.

In the following structure, **struct forth**, values marked with a '~~'
are serialized, the serialization takes place in order. Values are written
out as they are. The size of the Forth memory core gets stored in the header,
the size must be a power of two, so its binary logarithm can be stored
in a single byte.

**/
struct forth { /**< FORTH environment */
	uint8_t header[sizeof(header)]; /**< ~~ header for core file */
	forth_cell_t core_size;  /**< size of VM */
	uint8_t *s;          /**< convenience pointer for string input buffer */
	forth_cell_t *S;     /**< stack pointer */
	forth_cell_t *vstart;/**< index into m[] where variable stack starts*/
	forth_cell_t *vend;  /**< index into m[] where variable stack ends*/
	const struct forth_functions *calls; /**< functions for CALL instruction */
	int unget;           /**< single character of push back */

};

/**
@brief This enumeration describes the possible actions that can be taken when an
error occurs, by setting the right register value it is possible to make errors
halt the interpreter straight away, or even to make it invalidate the core.

This does not override the behavior of the virtual machine when it detects an
error that cannot be recovered from, only when it encounters an error such
as a divide by zero or a word not being found, not when the virtual machine
executes and invalid instruction (which should never normally happen unless
something has been corrupted).

	ERROR_HALT,       /**< halt on error */
	ERROR_INVALIDATE, /**< halt on error and invalid the Forth interpreter */
};

/**
@brief There are a small number of registers available to the virtual machine,
they are actually indexes into the virtual machines main memory, this is so
that the programs running on the virtual machine can access them.

There are other registers that are in use that the virtual machine cannot
access directly (such as the program counter or instruction pointer).
Some of these registers correspond directly to well known Forth concepts,
such as the dictionary and return stack pointers, others are just
implementation details.

X-Macros are an unusual but useful method of making tables
of data. We use this to store the registers name, it's address within
the virtual machine and the enumeration for it.

@brief The enum **input_stream** lists values of the **SOURCE_ID** register.

Input in Forth systems traditionally (tradition is a word we will keep using
here, generally in the context of programming it means justification for
cruft) came from either one of two places, the keyboard that the programmer
was typing at, interactively, or from some kind of non volatile store, such
as a floppy disk. Our C program has no portable way of interacting
directly with the keyboard, instead it could interact with a file handle
such as **stdin**, or read from a string. This is what we do in this
interpreter.

A word in Forth called **SOURCE-ID** can be used to query what the input device
currently is, the values expected are zero for interactive interpretation, or
minus one (minus one, or all bits set, is used to represent truth conditions
in most Forths, we are a bit more liberal in our definition of true) for string
input. These are the possible values that the **SOURCE_ID** register can take.
The **SOURCE-ID** word, defined in *forth.fth*, then does more processing
of this word.

Note that the meaning is slightly different in our Forth to what is meant
traditionally, just because this program is taking input from **stdin** (or
possibly another file handle), does not mean that this program is being
run interactively, it could possibly be part of a Unix pipe, which is
the reason the interpreter defaults to being as silent as possible.

/**
@brief **enum instructions** contains each virtual machine instruction, a valid
instruction is less than LAST. One of the core ideas of Forth is that
given a small set of primitives it is possible to build up a high level
language, given only these primitives it is possible to add conditional
statements, case statements, arrays and strings, even though they do not
exist as instructions here.

Most of these instructions are simple (such as; pop two items off the
variable stack, add them and push the result for **ADD**) however others are a
great deal more complex and will require paragraphs to explain fully
(such as **READ**, or how **IMMEDIATE** interacts with the virtual machines
execution).

The instruction name, enumeration and a help string, are all stored with
an X-Macro.

Some of these words are not necessary, that is they can be implemented in
Forth, but they are useful to have around when the interpreter starts
up for debugging purposes (like **pnum**).

@brief  Get a char from string input or a file
@param  o   forth image containing information about current input stream

This Forth interpreter only has a limited number of mechanisms for I/O, one
of these is to fetch an individual character of input from either a string
or a file which can be set either with knowledge of the implementation
from within the virtual machine, or via the API presented to the programmer.

The C functions **forth_init**, **forth_set_file_input** and
**forth_set_string_input** set up and manipulate the input of the
interpreter. These functions act on the following registers:

	SOURCE_ID - The current input source (SIN or FIN)
	SIN       - String INput
	SIDX      - String InDeX
	SLEN      - String LENgth
	FIN       - File   INput

Note that either SIN or FIN might not both be valid, one will be but the
other might not, this makes manipulating these values hazardous. The input
functions **forth_get_char** and **forth_ge\t_word** both take their input
streams implicitly via the registers contained within the Forth execution
environment passed in to those functions.

@note If the Forth interpreter is blocking, waiting for input, and
a signal occurs an EOF might be returned. This should be translated
into a 'throw', but it is not handled yet.

the behavior of the Forth run time.

In all Forth implementations there exists a concept of *the dictionary*,
although they may be implemented in different ways the usual way is as a
linked list of words, starting with the latest defined word and ending with
a special terminating value. Words cannot be arbitrarily deleted, deletions
have to occur in the reverse order that they are defined.

Each word or Forth function that has been defined can be looked up in this
dictionary, and dependent on whether it is an immediate word or a compiling
word, and whether we are in command or compile mode different actions are
taken when we have found the word we are looking for in our Read-Evaluate-Loop.

	    | <-- Start of VM memory
	    |             | <-- Start of dictionary
	    |             |
	.------------.    |  .------.      .------.             .-------------.
	| Terminator | <---- | Word | <--- | Word | < -- ... -- | Latest Word |
	.------------.    |  .------.      .------.             .-------------.
	    |                                                     ^
	    |                                                     |
	    |                                                   PWD Register

The **PWD** registers points to the latest defined word, a search starts from
here and works it way backwards (allowing us replace old definitions by
appending new ones with the same name), the terminator 'value' is actually any
value that points before the beginning of the dictionary.

Our word header looks like this:

	.-----------.-----.------.------------.
	| Word Name | PWD | CODE | Data Field |
	.-----------.-----.------.------------.

* The **Data Field** is optional and is of variable length.
* **Word Name** is a variable length field whose size is recorded in the
CODE field.

And the **CODE** field is a composite field, to save space, containing a virtual
machine instruction, the hidden bit, the compiling bit, and the length of
the Word  Name string as an offset in cells from **PWD** field.

The field looks like this:


	.---------------.------------------.------------.-------------.
	|      15       | 14 ........... 8 |    9       | 7 ....... 0 |
	| Compiling Bit |  Word Name Size  | Hidden Bit | Instruction |
	.---------------.------------------.------------.-------------.

The maximum value for the Word Name field is determined by the width of
the Word Name Size field.

The hidden bit is not used in the **compile** function, but is used
elsewhere (in **forth_find**) to hide a word definition from the word
search. The hidden bit is not set within this program at all, however it
can be set by a running Forth virtual machine (and it is, if desired).

The compiling bit tells the text interpreter/compiler what to do with the
word when it is read in from the input, if set it will be compiled into
the dictionary if in compile mode and in command mode it will be executed,
if it is cleared the word will always be executed.

The instruction is the virtual machine instruction that is to be executed
by the interpreter.

/**
The following section will explain how the threaded virtual machine interpreter
works. Threaded code is a simple concept and Forths typically compile
their code to threaded code, it suites Forth implementations as word
definitions consist of juxtaposition of previously defined words until they
reach a set of primitives.

This means a function like **square** will be implemented like this:

	call dup   <- duplicate the top item on the variable stack
	call *     <- push the result of multiplying the top two items
	call exit  <- exit the definition of square

Each word definition is like this, a series of calls to other functions. We
can optimize this by removing the explicit **call** and just having a series
of code address to jump to, which will become:

	address of "dup"
	address of "*"
	address of "exit"

We now have the problem that we cannot just jump to the beginning of the
definition of **square** in our virtual machine, we instead use an instruction
(**RUN** in our interpreter, or **DOLIST** as it is sometimes known in most
other implementations) to determine what to do with the following data, if there
is any. This system also allows us to encode primitives, or virtual machine
instructions, in the same way as we encode words. If our word does not have
the **RUN** instruction as its first instruction then the list of addresses will
not be interpreted but only a simple instruction will be executed.

The for loop and the switch statement here form the basis of our thread code
interpreter along with the program counter register (**pc**) and the instruction
pointer register (**I**).

To explain how execution proceeds it will help to refer to the internal
structure of a word and how words are compiled into the dictionary.

Above we saw that a words layout looked like this:

	.-----------.-----.------.----------------.
	| Word Name | PWD | CODE | Data Field ... |
	.-----------.-----.------.----------------.

And we can define words like this:

	: square dup * ;

Which, on a 32 bit machine, produces code that looks like this:

	Address        Contents
	         ._____._____._____._____.
	  X      | 's' | 'q' | 'u' | 'a' |
	         ._____._____._____._____.
	  X+1    | 'r' | 'e' |  0  |  0  |
	         ._____._____._____._____.
	  X+2    | previous word pointer |
	         ._______________________.
	  X+3    |       CODE Field      |
	         ._______________________.
	  X+4    | Pointer to 'dup'      |
	         ._______________________.
	  X+5    | Pointer to '*'        |
	         ._______________________.
	  X+6    | Pointer to 'exit'     |
	         ._______________________.

The **:** word creates the header (everything up to and including the CODE
field), and enters compile mode, where instead of words being executed they
are compiled into the dictionary. When **dup** is encountered a pointer is
compiled into the next available slot at **X+4**, likewise for *****. The word
**;** is an immediate word that gets executed regardless of mode, which switches
back into compile mode and compiles a pointer to **exit**.

This **CODE** field at **X+3** contains the following:

	         .---------------.------------------.------------.-------------.
	Bit      |      15       | 14 ........... 8 |    9       | 7 ....... 0 |
	Field    | Compiling Bit |  Word Name Size  | Hidden Bit | Instruction |
	Contents |      1        |        2         |    0       |   RUN (1)   |
	         .---------------.------------------.------------.-------------.

The definition of words mostly consists of pointers to other words. The
compiling bit, Word Name Size field and Hidden bit have no effect when
the word is execution, only in finding the word and determining whether to
execute it when typing the word in. The instruction tells the virtual machine
what to do with this word, in this case the instruction is **RUN**, which means
that the words contains a list of pointers to be executed. The virtual machine
then pushes the value of the next address to execute onto the return stack
and then jumps to that words CODE field, executing the instruction it finds
for that word.

Words like **dup** and ***** are built in words, they are slightly differently
in that their **CODE** field contains contains a virtual machine instruction
other than **RUN**, they contain the instructions **DUP** and **MUL**
respectively.

move this word outside of the virtual machine a compiler for the virtual

but simplify the virtual machine and make it more like a 'normal' virtual
machine.

It attempts to do the follow:

a) Lookup a space delimited string in the Forth dictionary, if it is found
and we are in command mode we execute it, if we are in compile mode and
the word is a compiling word we compile a pointer to it in the dictionary,
if not we execute it.
b) If it is not a word in the dictionary we attempt to treat it as a number,
if it is numeric (using the **BASE** register to determine the base)
then if we are in command mode we push the number to the variable stack,
else if we are in compile mode we compile the literal into the dictionary.
c) If it is neither a word nor a number, regardless of mode, we emit a
diagnostic.

This is the most complex word in the Forth virtual machine, there is a good
case for it being moved outside of it, and perhaps this will happen. You
will notice that the above description did not include any looping, as such
there is a driver for the interpreter which must be made and initialized
